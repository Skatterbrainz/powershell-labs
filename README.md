# PowerShell Labs

## Welcome!

This GitHub repo contains assorted PowerShell code snippets published in .NET Interactive Notebook files.

The basis of this was heavily inspired by the [MMS](https://mmsmoa.com) presentation materials by Scott Corio 
([@scottcorio](https://twitter.com/ScottCorio)) and Nathan Ziehnert ([@theznerd](https://twitter.com/theznerd)).

That led me down a rabbit for hours, days, weeks, exploring how different approaches to a given task could vary widely with
regards to performance.

Please help support [MMS MOA](https://mmsmoa.com), as well as Scott and Nathan, and user groups like:

* Research Triangle PowerShell User Group ([RTPSUG](https://rtpsug.com/))
* Denver Modern Endpoint Management User Group ([Denver MEMUG](https://memug.org/))
* [PowerShell.org](https://www.PowerShell.org)
* [Matthew Dowst](https://twitter.com/mdowst) - [Book](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-automation-with-powershell) - [Newsletter](https://psweekly.dowst.dev/)

These have helped me many many times! I'm sure they'll be helpful to you as well.

## How to Use These Examples

* Install Visual Studio Code
* Install the Visual Studio Code extensions:
  * PowerShell (or PowerShell Preview)
  * .NET Interactive Notebooks (requires the .NET 6 SDK also)

## Tips

* Run each code block in order from top to bottom (gradually, compare output times)
* Run each code block at least 3 times, to get an average time
* Try modifying the examples to see how it affects execution time
* Share feedback here using the "Issues" link above

Enjoy!
