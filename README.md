# PowerShell Labs

Assorted code snippets published in .NET Interactive Notebook files. Many were inspired by
the MMS presentation materials by Scott Corio (@scorio) and Nathan Ziehnert (@theznerd). From that
I started playing and exploring other areas where PowerShell performance matters.

## Setup

For best results, use Visual Studio Code with the .NET Interactive Notebooks extension. That extension
will also require the .NET 6 SDK, and you should have the PowerShell (or PowerShell Preview) extension
installed as well.
