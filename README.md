# PowerShell Labs

Assorted code snippets published in .NET Interactive Notebook files. Many were inspired by
the [MMS](https://mmsmoa.com) presentation materials by Scott Corio ([@scorio](https://twitter.com/scorio)) 
and Nathan Ziehnert ([@theznerd](https://twitter.com/theznerd)). From there,
I started exploring other areas where PowerShell performance matters.

## Setup

For best results, use Visual Studio Code with the .NET Interactive Notebooks extension. That extension
will also require the .NET 6 SDK, and you should have the PowerShell (or PowerShell Preview) extension
installed as well.

## Tips

* Run each example in order from top to bottom
* Run each code block at least 3 times, to get an average time
* Play with each example (modify the code) and test again

Enjoy!
